# primary key - secondary key

# primary key

- imagine row-store-database
- unique
- table spaces = heap
- no order by default
- `clustering` = add `primary key`
- `clustered index` = `primary key`
- we have to maintain order by adding `primary key`
- insert row data need to be fit in order
- index-organized-table in Oracle
- `primary key = clustered` index is for speed

# secondary key

- additional outside structure
- table are mess, row-id is mess
